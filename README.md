# Jump-Contagion
 
This repository illustrates and provides code for the estimation procedure developed in the paper **Jump Contagion among Stock Market Indices: Evidence from Option Markets** written by Peter Boswijk, Roger Laeven, Andrei Lalu and Evgenii Vladimirov. The paper is available on [SSRN](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3929515).

# Simulated data

The illustration is based on simulated data from the bivariate option pricing models proposed in the paper. The simulated data are stored as MATLAB .mat file in `data`. The state vectors are simulated using an Euler discretization and the option prices are computed using the COS method. For further details concerning the simulations, see Section 3 of the paper.
